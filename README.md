# Wordle Solver

This application is a solver for the five letter word guessing - wordle. This solver was made in python and is free for everyone to use. There might be other solvers out there too but this is my approach to it.<br>

This application has only been tested on Windows yet. Bugs exist for other operating systems, but they will soon be fixed ASAP.


## Requirements

To run this program, all you need is the following:

- Python 3
- Python's customtkinter module

```bash

```
